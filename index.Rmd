<p style="text-align: justify;">Following on the announcement to relocate Indonesia’s capital to Borneo, this project aims to identify a suitable site to house the new capital through detailed analysis of the geographical factors of selected districts in East Kalimantan. This move was designed with the objectives of addressing economic and developmental inequality between Jakarta and the rest of Indonesia, in addition to easing the burden Jakarta, and the island of Java currently face, with Java housing 60% of Indonesia’s population and accounting for more than half of Indonesia’s economic activity. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To decide on the most appropriate area for housing the new capital, we would first thoroughly analyze our study area made up of various districts in East Kalimantan, and put forward  recommendations for a suitable site using factors we considered and weighed. </p>
