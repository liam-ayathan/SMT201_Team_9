# SMT201 August to November 2021

Hey everyone we are a group of students majoring in Smart-City Management Technology! This semester we embarked on the module SMT201 - Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning. For our final project we were tasked to find and determine a suitable site for Indonesia's new capital in East Kalimantan, situated on the island of Borneo.

Using publically available data, we conducted a survey of East Kalimantan, site suitability analysis for the new capital area using the *Analytic Hierarchy Process* (AHP) and finally designed a GIS model/database.

We then deployed our project on a website which can be found here!: https://smt201-team-9.netlify.app/
